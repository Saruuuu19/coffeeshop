# ☕ CoffeeCo.

This project is a modern landing page for a coffee shop, built primarily as a demonstration of skills in **Static Site Generation (SSG)** and **Component Islands**.

## 🎯 Core Learning Objectives

This project was a practical exercise to master high-performance front-end architecture:

* **Astro & SSG:** Focused on building an ultra-fast website by utilizing Astro's Static Site Generation to deliver **zero-JavaScript** by default.
* **Component Islands (Preact):** Implemented the mobile hamburger menu using **Preact** and the `client:load` directive. This demonstrates **selective hydration**, isolating interactivity to keep the rest of the site purely static. 
* **Tailwind CSS:** Used for quick, efficient styling and implementing a **responsive, mobile-first** design aesthetic.
* **Data Handling:** Practiced fetching local data (`menu.js`) and iterating over it to generate HTML during the **build phase** (compile-time).
